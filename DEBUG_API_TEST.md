# Debug API Test

Let's test the API directly to see what's happening.

## Step 1: Test the API directly

**Start just the API (not the AppHost):**
```bash
cd src/CarSelling.Api
dotnet run
```

**Watch the console output carefully** - you should see:
```
=== STARTING DATABASE INITIALIZATION ===
Environment: Development
Connection String: Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=CarSellingDb;...
FORCE: Recreating database with latest schema...
Database deleted successfully.
Database created successfully.
Tables created: CarListings, Users, CarBrands, CarModels
=== STARTING SAMPLE DATA SEEDING ===
...
=== DATABASE VERIFICATION ===
Brands: 89
Models: 45
```

## Step 2: Test the API endpoints

Once the API is running, open these URLs in your browser:
- `http://localhost:5000/api/carbrand` or `http://localhost:5004/api/carbrand`
- `http://localhost:5000/api/carmodel/names-by-brand/Toyota`

**Expected result:** Should return JSON with 89 brands and Toyota models.

## Step 3: If the API works but the frontend doesn't

The issue is likely:
1. **Wrong API URL** - The frontend might be calling the wrong API endpoint
2. **CORS issues** - The API might be blocking the frontend calls
3. **AppHost configuration** - The AppHost might not be starting the API correctly

## Step 4: Check browser network tab

1. Open the Create Listing page
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Watch for API calls to `/api/carbrand`
5. Check if there are any errors or if it's calling the wrong URL

## What to report back:

1. Does the API start successfully with the debug logs?
2. Do the direct API URLs return 89 brands?
3. What do you see in the browser Network tab when loading the Create Listing page?
