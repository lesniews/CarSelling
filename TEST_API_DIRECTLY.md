# Test API Directly

Let's bypass the AppHost and test the API directly to see if our database initialization works.

## Step 1: Run the SQL Script
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio
2. Connect to `(localdb)\mssqllocaldb` 
3. Run the script `MANUAL_DATABASE_SETUP.sql`
4. Verify you see 5 brands and 12 models

## Step 2: Test API Directly
```bash
cd src/CarSelling.Api
dotnet run
```

This should:
- Start the API on its own (not through AppHost)
- Trigger our database initialization code
- Show all the debug logs we added

## Step 3: Test Endpoints
Once the API is running, test these URLs:
- `http://localhost:5004/api/carbrand` - Should return brands
- `http://localhost:5004/api/carmodel/names-by-brand/Toyota` - Should return Toyota models

## Step 4: Check Database
After running the API directly, check if the database has more data than the manual script.

## If This Works
Then the issue is with the AppHost configuration, not our code.

## If This Doesn't Work  
Then there's an issue with our database initialization code.
